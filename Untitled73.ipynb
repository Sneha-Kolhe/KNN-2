    "Sensitivity to Scale: Euclidean distance is sensitive to the scale of the features, whereas Manhattan distance is less sensitive to scale. If the features in your dataset have significantly different scales, Euclidean distance may give too much weight to features with larger scales, potentially leading to inaccurate results. In such cases, using Manhattan distance might provide better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effect on Decision Boundaries: The choice of distance metric affects the shape of decision boundaries in the feature space. Euclidean distance tends to create spherical decision boundaries around each data point, while Manhattan distance creates hyper-rectangular boundaries. Depending on the distribution of the data, one distance metric may be more suitable than the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Efficiency: Calculating Manhattan distance involves summing the absolute differences between coordinates, which may be computationally more efficient than calculating the square root of the sum of squared differences required for Euclidean distance, especially in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the choice between Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance in KNN depends on the characteristics of the dataset, such as feature scales, distribution of data, and computational considerations. It's often beneficial to experiment with both distance metrics and choose the one that yields the best performance for a specific problem."
